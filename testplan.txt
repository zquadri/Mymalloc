Workload E:
	mallocs 1 byte, then 2 bytes , then 3 bytes.... Until  50 bytes.
	after 25 Malloc calls free all 25.
	Then continue and at 50 malloc calls free the remaining 25

We included this workload: 
To ensure that malloc and free work fine when dealing with a medium value of bytes consecutively and then freed in a specific order.


Workload F: 

	 malloc 1500 bytes twice then free them. Do this 2x;
	 then malloc a single byte twice and then free that.
	 then repeat the first process one last time.


We included this to workload:
Make sure that malloc and free can handle cases where user asks to malloc and free large amounts of bytes.
